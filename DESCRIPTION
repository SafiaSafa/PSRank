Title:  A simple package to evaluate the efficiency of ranking statistics for polygenic score prediction
Version: 0.1.0

Description: The population is separated into two sets of data:
    A learning set where will be estimated associations through linear univariate model. This set of SNPs is going to be sorted. The packages allows to sorte the SNPs according differentes scores. By P-values, Î² or I-score.
    And a test set where will be calculated a cumulative score, called "polygenic risk score"  and on which we will evaluate the predictivity
