Reading map (extended format) from [ sim9d.bim ] 
10000 markers to be included from [ sim9d.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ sim9d.fam ] 
2000 individuals read from [ sim9d.fam ] 
2000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
508 cases, 1492 controls and 0 missing
1000 males, 1000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ sim9d.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10000 SNPs
2000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10000 SNPs
After filtering, 508 cases, 1492 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 1000 males, 1000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
